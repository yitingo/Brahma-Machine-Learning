For "India Air Quality", I completed simple data cleaning and exploration on data related to India Air Quality.
Packages I used include: pandas, numpy, SimmpleImputer (from sklearn.impute), and matplotlib.
In order to get more information from the data set, I:
First, get a general idea of the data set by reading into description, shape, count, null values, range, column, 
  number of non-null objects of each column, datatype, and memory used about this dataset
Then, I dropped some of the useless columns, changed datatypes so they become uniform, simplified information (from year-month-date to year),
  removed null values.
Also calculated needed values of certain groups and displayed in table and bar charts.
At the end, I found the trends of So2, No2, spm and rspm in the Andhra Pradesh state.
